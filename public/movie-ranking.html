    <h1>The Best Movies According to Myles</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Dune 1 & 2</h3>
    <p>Beautiful visuals, a score that goes perfectly with the movies, and great acting.</p>
    <h3>Fight Club</h3>
    <p>Insanity. Pure insanity.</p>
    <h3>The Wizard of Oz</h3>
    <p>I'm not sure I've watched any other movie more times. As a kid, being transported to that world felt magical.</p>
